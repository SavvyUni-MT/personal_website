I am also the assistant director of CANSSI Ontario, a senior fellow at Massey College, a faculty affiliate at the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society, and a co-lead of the DSI Thematic Program in Reproducibility.\nMy book, Telling Stories With Data, argues that a trustworthiness revolution is needed in data science, and I propose a view of what it could look like. It has been strongly endorsed, including: Andrew Gelman “I absolutely love this book”, Kosuke Imai “I highly recommend this unique book!”, Sir David Spiegelhalter “[A]n extraordinary, wonderful, book…”, Daniela Witten “An excellent book”, and Richard McElreath “This is not another statistics book. It is much better than that.” You can buy a print copy here and you can access the free online version here."
